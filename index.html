            <h3>Why Japan?</h3>
            <h2>Japan is full of color and culture</h2>
            <p>
              Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is in the northwest
              Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan,
              extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East
              China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a
              part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125
              islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the
              "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's
              capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya,
              Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.
            </p>
            <p>
              Japan has over 125 milion inhabitants and is the 11th most
              populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely
              populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is
              mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on
              narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative
              prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area
              is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the
              world's highest life expectancy.
